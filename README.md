Digital Album

3 main components: clients, servers, gateway.

The architecture betwenn clinets and servers/gateway is client-server architecture.
The communications between servers are based in a peer to peer architecture.

The project is a digital album. The client connects to the gateway that gives the ip of a server. Then, the client can communicate with the server, to upload, download, and remove photos, give tags/hashtags.

The communications are done using TCP and UDP protocols implemeted in C, and it was developed a speficic API for this service.
